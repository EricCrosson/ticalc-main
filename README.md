# TI-Calc Archive

This is a modest collection of calculator programs written for the
TI-83 family.

## Project structure

Each directory consists of an individual project. Browse through each
project folder to become more acquainted with each separate program.

## Other download locations

These programs are available on ticalc.org, though donations aren't
available through their interface. Don't let that prohibit you from
buying me a beer! Though I hate asking for money, donations directly
correlate with time not spent doing some more menial work. This time
can be better spent programming, and putting the results of my labor
on the internet for folks like you to enjoy. Until the day I can code
nonstop without financial worry, I will be accepting donations through
PayPal.
