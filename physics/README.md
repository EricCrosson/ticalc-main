# Physics

Physics is a program that contains many nifty physics equations in a
easy-to-navigate menu system. There is one un-implemented feature, the
one to assign constants to your variables. But, the information is all
there, and it can be mighty helpful in a crunch.

This was designed using the AP Physics formula sheet, c 2011.
