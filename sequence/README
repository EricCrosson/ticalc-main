* Sequence
Sequence is a program to help visualize a sequence of numbers. All
stages of the program are explained below.

** Phase I: Prompt
The user will be prompted as in prompt.bmp. Here, enter the sequence
to explore. I will enter 3X^2. Hit `enter' to accept the input.

Note: if Y1 already contains an equation, that will be used as the
initial seed for the sequence explorer.

** Phase II: Explore
The beginning of the sequence will be cast upon the screen, with the
visible range denoted on the left. Below is a table of keys and their
actions:

| Key   | Action                  |
