* Midpoint
Midpoint is a program to calculate the middle of a given set of
points, in any dimension.

** Input
Enter as many coordinates as there are for 2 separate points, and hit
enter to see the middle point. For a normal cartesian plane, enter two
values. For 3 dimensional space, enter 3 values. To get insight into
hyperbeings, enter 11 or more coordinates, this program will calculate
the midpoint of anything.
