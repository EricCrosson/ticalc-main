* Zeroes
Zeroes is a program to display all the zeroes of a function (Y1)
across the current visible window.

** Invoking Zeroes
Feeding information into zeroes is simple. If Y1 currently has a
value, zeroes will use that value as its input. If Y1 is empty the
user will be prompted for an equation.

** Examining the zeroes
To examine the zeroes, scroll the list left and right with the arrow keys.

** Changing the domain or function
At any point during the examination of data, press the `TRACE' key (or
windows) to adjust the window, or `Y=' to adjust the current
function.

** Quitting
Press enter to quit zeroes.
